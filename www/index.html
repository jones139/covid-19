    <h1>Teesside COVID-19 Tracker</h1>
    <p>The charts below show the data published by <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/ae5dda8f86814ae99dde905d2a9070ae">Public Health England</a> for individual local authority areas around Teesside.</p>
    <p>The first chart is just a representation of the historical data
      available on the Public Health England dashboard (their dashboard only
      shows a table, not a graph)</p>
    <p>The second chart shows the data corrected for the population of the
      local authority areas to give a better comparison of the density of
      infections.   The population data is obtained from the Mid Year
      Estimates published by the
      <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland">
	Office for National Statistics</a>.</p>
    <h3>Remember Folks - Never make a judgement that relies on the last data point in a time series!</h3>
    <p>The data is processed using the
      <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> data analysis library
      using the scipts published
      <a href="https://github.com/jones139/covid-19">here</a>.
      It should be updated every day automatically (if I have programmed my
      computer correctly.....)
